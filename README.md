## My Journey: From University Dropout to Engineering Leadership

- **2016** – Dropped out of university in Greece, moved to London with no degree, no connections, and no safety net.  
  *One month later, landed my first Software Engineering job.*

- **2019** – Became an Engineering Manager at a Cyber Security company.  
  *Led teams protecting millions from cyber threats.*

- **2022** – Promoted to Senior EM / Head of Engineering at a high-growth startup.  
  *Managed 4 global teams & 25+ open-source libraries.*

- **2024 & Beyond** – Leading GenAI at Zopa Bank.  
  *Writing a Blog for Engineering Managers and coaching engineers to transition into leadership roles.*
