### I skipped uni to chase my dream in London - and it was the best decision I ever made.

I skipped uni to chase my dream in London - and it was the best decision I ever made.

Here‚Äôs what happened:

<strong>2016</strong>

‚Ü≥ Dropped out of university in Greece.

‚Ü≥ Moved to London with no degree, no connections, but a dream - to work as a software engineer.

‚Ü≥ Got my first software engineering job within 1 month.

<strong>2019</strong>

‚Ü≥ Landed an Engineering Manager role at a leading Cyber Security company.

‚Ü≥ Led a team that developed solutions protecting millions of users from cyber threats.

<strong>2022</strong>

‚Ü≥ Moved to a Senior EM / Head of Engineering role at a high growth startup.

‚Ü≥ Managing 4 global teams (20+ engineers) and 25 open-source libraries.

<strong>2024 & Beyond</strong>

‚Ü≥ Managing a talented team to build a highly confidential (and super cool) GenAI tool at Zopa Bank ü§ê 

‚Ü≥ Writing a Blog for Engineering Managers

‚Ü≥ Coaching engineers to confidently transition into leadership roles.

I‚Äôve coached 100+ engineers, helping them land leadership positions and increase their impact.
